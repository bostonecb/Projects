# My Project Portfolio

### "Twitter" Database Projects (Private Repositories)
- **Tech Stack:** MongoDB, MySQL, SQL, Python
- **Description:** Designed and developed two different programs: one with a user interface integrated with a MongoDB (NoSQL) database, and another with a similar interface integrated with a SQL (relational) database. Both programs manage tweets and user interactions, simulating Twitter.
- **Key Contributions:**
  * Leveraged efficient database querying in order to implement features for creating and viewing tweets, following users, searching for user profiles, and listing followers.
- **Access:** Private repository (code samples available upon request).

  - **Multi-User Roles:** **Entrants:** Join event waiting lists, receive notifications, and are randomly selected for events, **Organizers:** Create and manage events, select participants from waiting lists, and send notifications, **Administrators:** Manage users, events, and other app data.
  - **Geolocation Verification:** Organizers can enable geolocation verification to ensure users are within a certain area when joining a waiting list.
  - **Profile Customization:** Entrants can upload and manage their profile pictures for a personalized experience.
  - **Notifications:** Entrants are notified when they are selected (or not selected) for an event, and organizers can notify all Entrants, selected participants, and those who are canceled.
